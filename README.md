# Word Counter

Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is a word counter built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It simply counts the number of words you have in your text.


## How to use

Although this is a very simple frontend application, for practice, I created a `Dockerfile` to create an image for this application. It was also pushed to Docker hub via github Actions. 

This process makes setting this application up very simple. The following steps can be used to set up this project on your local machine.

- Clone the repository
- Build the Docker image
  ```
  Docker build -t wordcounter .
  ```
- Run the Dockerfile
  ```
  docker run -p 80:80 wordcounter:latest
  ```
 - On your browser, view `localhost`

**Note:**

You have write the text in the text area form and click on the button to count the text. This project's main feature is built using one of JavaScript's string manipulation technique, the `split()` method.
